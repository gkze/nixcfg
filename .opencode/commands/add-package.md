## description: Add a new package to this nixcfg flake

Load the `nix-add-package` skill and use it to guide adding a new package to this repository.

The skill covers three main patterns:

1. Flake input with packages/overlays
1. Non-flake source input (build from source)
1. External binary / rolling-release app

Ask clarifying questions to determine which pattern fits the package being added.

Package to add: $ARGUMENTS
