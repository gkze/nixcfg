# nixcfg: Nix configuration

Mostly for macOS, Linux TBD / WIP

## Installation

Ideally, it'd be:

```shell
curl -Ls https://github.com/gkze/nixcfg/raw/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

But there are still some errors that need to be ironed out.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:gkze/nixcfg ~/.config/nixcfg
cd ~/.config/nixcfg
./bootstrap.sh
./deploy.sh
```

Not 100% yet...
